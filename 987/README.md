# 987 
A fork of [2048](https://https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli.  I thought it would be nice to try the same game mechanics for other mathematical sequences... This one is using Fibonacci sequences. Next up will be a version using prime factors.

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://cozmic72.github.io/987/)

## Notes on gameplay
For fairly obvious reasons, I ommitted the 0 tile, and randomly generate ones and threes.  (Generating twos would be a bit pointless...) I tweaked the probablilities to make it challenging enough yet not too frustrating.  With the current settings, in my experience, 987 is quite achievable, but I have not managed to get it to 1597 more than once.

Try setting the probability to 75% for a bit more of a challange.
